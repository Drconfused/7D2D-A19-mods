	-Lights outside of the base can be picked up and become player lights that require power.
	-Can we make the flashlights like the lanterns? Currently this method does not work, the lantern works the way it does because of how it was modelled and the flashlightdecor is not modelled in the same way, so the only way to make the vanilla version light work as a player light is to make it require a power connection. unless I can find some other method to change this through xml.
